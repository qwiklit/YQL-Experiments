        </p>
          <p>The Pylon opened in October of 1939. The neighbourhood was predominantly British then. It is now Little Italy. Ray Lewis was the original owner. She put a roller skating rink ath the back of the theatre and a dance hall on the second floor.</p>
        <p>In the late 1950's the demographics in the neighbourhood changed with an influx of Italian immigrants. Rocco Mastrangelo, owner of the Café Diplomatico, bought the theatre and started screening Italian films. In the 1990's, this theatre was briefly called The Golden Princess, screening mostly Asian films.</p>

        <p>This magnificent theatre first opened in 1913. It contains two full-sized theatres stacked on top of each other. Very few of these stacked theatres were ever built and this is the only one that survives in Canada</p>
        <p>The lower theatre was called "Loew's Yonge Street Theatre". With seating for 2149 patrons, it was intended to be the flagship facility for the expanding vaudeville and film empire of New York's Marcus Loew. Irving Berlin came to the opening night. Back then, a typical show at Loew's consisted of 8 to 10 vaudeville acts with  a silent film and a newsreel. It was affectionately known as a "Grind House" because performers had to continuously grind out shows starting at 11 in the morning. </p>
        <p>The Winter Garden Theatre was seven stories above Loew's and could accommodate 1410 patrons. It opened in 1914.  The décor of this theatre attempted to recreate an English country garden with cotton blossoms and real beech leaves dipped in preservatives. In 1928, after only 18 years in operation, this vaudeville theatre closed. Movies had taken over. </p>

        <p><br> <img src="http://www.myseumoftoronto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/standard-after.jpg"><br><br></p>
    <p>The Standard Theatre opened in 1921. It was designed by the first registered Jewish architect in Toronto, Benjamin Brown. He also designed the beautiful Balfour Building further down Spadina and Adelaide. At one time The Standard was one of the finest Yiddish Theatres in North America. It was financed by selling shares to the local Kensington Market merchants. Melodrama! Comedies! Tragedies! New York touring companies performing Shakespeare in Yiddish.</p>
        <p>In 1929, the local constabulary was called to break up a meeting at the theatre commemorating the death of Lenin. The pretext for this raid? It was illegal at that time to address a group in any language but English. In 1933, the Progressive Arts Club presented a play called Eight Men Speak, a defense of 8 imprisoned Communist Party leaders. The first performance sold out and the second was shut down when the local police threatenend to revoke the theatre's license. </p>

        </p>
        <p>"This theatre would run Westerns all day for next to nothing. John Wayne, Horror, you name it. it was the place to be in the early 60s."</p>
        <p>The Orpheum Theatre opened in 1930 and it was run by the Rittenberg family. This theatre provided an affordable escape from the harsh realities of Depression-era Toronto. The theatre once had 500 well-padded seats for their patrons with another 146 in the balcony, but it shtut down in 1977 because of the growing popularity of television. In 1983 it re-opened as The Golden Dragon, but then closed again in 1987 to become a jewelry store.</p>

        <p><img src="http://www.myseumoftoronto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/revue-before.jpg"><br><br></p>
<p>This theatre was built in 1911 and 1912 by The Suburban Amusement Company. It was owned by Jacob Smith and featured film and live theatre. This cinema screened silent films during the First World War, helping Torontonians escape the grim reality of that war.</p>
<p>Movies were also very populr during the Great Depression, and in 1929, this cinema converted to screen "talkies". Throughout the 1960s, German films were regularly shown to serve west-end Toronto's growing German-speaking population. Thanks to community support, it didn't shut down in 2006 and is now operated by the not-for-profit Revue Film Society.</p>

              <p>This neighbourhood theatre opened just after the First World War. It was originally licensed to two brothers--Clarence and William Welsman.</p>
        <p>With 400 wooden seats with backs covered in leatherette, the Brighton had a cozy feel to it in comparison to larger theatres. The building was more than just for entertainment. The theatre had no balcony but it had third floor apartments facing south. It was truly a comunity space.</p>

              <p>The Allen Brothers opened this palace in the spirng of 1920. They also owned and operated the Allen's on Bloor an the Allen's on the Danforth. The Sunnyside Amusement Park opened two years later helping to supply audiences looking to escape the summer heat--come for the fair, stay for the movie--it worked.</p>
        <p>With 1546 seats thi beautiful theatre was fully fireproof, so smoking was advertised and in 1938, air-conditioning was added.</p>
           <p>On February 21, 1950, two detectives overpowered a notorious bank-robber named "Baby-Faced Byers" in this theatre. He was 30 but he looked younger. When he was arrested he reached for his gun but failed to draw in time. If he had, the story might have ended differently.</p>

              <p>Opened in 1919, Allen's Danforth Theatre was part of the Allan chain of theatres operated by two brothers Jay and Jule Allan. It was a big place with 1600 seats and it was designed by Hynes, Feldman and Watson who were part of the Detroit architectural firm of Howard Crane. This firm also designed both of the other Allan theatres. This was also a vaudeville house and in an attempt to project an image of respectability, the Allan's advertised their theatre as "Canada's First Super Photoplay Palace".</p>
        <p>This theatre was taken over by Famous Players in 1923, renamed the Century and in 1919, converted to films that included sound, or 'talkies'. By the 1970s, this site was named the Tatania and was screening second-run films, kung-fu flicks and Greek movies for the local Greek community.</p>

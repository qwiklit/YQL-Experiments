Wi-Fi service is available at this station. The station was opened in 1968 in what was then the Borough of Etobicoke. The original plan for the Bloor-Danforth extension to Islington had different stations than what was eventually built. The stations were to be at 'Montgomery' and 'Prince Edward', instead of Islington and Royal York. This was probably because these two streets were the ends of the Kingsway shopping district. However, it was decided to include only one station in the Kingsway, at Royal York.Until 1973 the buses and the subway trains serving the station were in separate fare zones and so the turnstiles and collector booths were on the mezzanine level between the bus bays and the subway platforms. When the zones were abolished, they were moved to just inside the street entrance, bringing the buses inside the station's fare-paid area."

Wi-Fi service is available at this station.The station consists of two separate sections, one for each line, at the same level and 150 metres apart. The north–south platforms, which opened in 1978, were originally planned as a separate station, but the TTC decided to join to the existing 1966 east–west station with a pedestrian tunnel containing a pair of long moving walkways. The cost of the moving walkways themselves became an issue when they became due for refurbishment or replacement, and they were shut down and ultimately removed in 2004, leaving the corridor as a simple underground walkway. The former location of the moving walkways remains visible because the tiles used to cover their removal are noticeably different. Warnings to hold the handrails are still embossed on the walls where the ends of the moving walkways were once located.An underground loop for the 510 Spadina streetcar was added in 1997 near the east end of the east–west platforms. The streetcar platform adds Postmodern finishes to the station's mix of styles. These range from the basic Modernist tiles of the Bloor–Danforth line platform, to the more intricate round tiles and backlit signage of the Yonge–University line platform. In 1997, this station became accessible only to the Bloor–Danforth platforms and exit."

Wi-Fi is available at this station.The station was opened in 1954 and designed by Charles B. Dolphin.[3] It was originally named “Bloor” , and connected with a pair of enclosed platforms in the centre of Bloor Street to allow interchange with Bloor streetcars within the fare-paid zone. When the streetcars were replaced with the Bloor-Danforth subway in 1966, the station began to be shown on maps as “Bloor–Yonge” . However, actual platform signs still show “Bloor”  on the Yonge–University line and “Yonge”  on the Bloor–Danforth line, following a naming style common in New York subway station complexes, where only the platform's cross street is shown on the platform signs."

The residence was named after his son Francis Simcoe. In 1954 a historical marker was placed in Prince Edward Viaduct Parkette, near the site of the historic Castle Frank residence, on the south side of Bloor Street at Castle Frank Road.The Parliament streetcar operated to its northerly terminus at the Viaduct Loop until 1966. No consideration was given to construct the short connection, from that location at Bloor Street East and Parliament Street across the Rosedale Ravine, which would have made the streetcar route a genuine feeder line to the subway station. The site of the steetcar loop is now Bloor - Parliament Parkette."

In addition, repairs were made to the saw-tooth bus platforms and the roadway was repaved for low floor buses. The northside entrance remains inaccessible due to space restrictions and generally used as drop off point by car.</p><p>Dunlop Farrow Aitken was the firm responsible for the station's architecture. The structure is composed of an enclosed train platform area in the median of Allen Road, which is bridged by a bus loop and waiting area on the south side of the Lawrence Avenue bridge. Staffed entrances on both sides of the street connect to a transfer area which links the train platform and the bus area. Upon entrance from the Lawrence Avenue bridge over Allen Road, the bus waiting area and the train platform are apparent. This openness is achieved through glazed walls and a large stairwell. The glass is framed with distinctive orange-painted metal. The platform level features exposed concrete walls, with a long strip of skylights above the tracks with the same orange framing used throughout the station.

Unlike Yorkdale, the curve is less sudden making the walls more rounded in appearance and they are clad with white horizontal panels between vertical concrete 'ribs', along with a wider orange panel strip displaying the station name. Platform level seating is sheltered within glass walls. Wayfinding signage is backlit. Floors and some of the walls are clad with red-brown tiles. Glencairn formerly featured a multi colour stained glass skylight entitled Joy designed by Rita Letendre, which was removed at the artist's request after it became faded, and replaced with clear glass. The skylight is set to be refurbished; the artwork is planned to be reinstated at that time.</p>"

In 1978 when the station opened, a trolley bus route (63 Ossington) served the station and looped around the station building. To coincide with the station opening, the route was extended from its prior terminus at Oakwood Avenue and Eglinton Avenue. The route ran south to the loop at King Street. In 1992, the route was converted to diesel buses and the overhead wires were removed.Eglinton West had been planned to be an interchange station as part of the proposed Eglinton West line (not to be confused with the Eglinton Crosstown line). This was one of the three proposed subway lines in the Network 2011 Plan created in 1985 by the Toronto Transit Commission. The project was cancelled in 1995 after the election of a Progressive Conservative government led by Mike Harris. Afterwards, the small amount of tunnel that had been dug under the station was refilled.</p><p>The station building is located on the north side of Eglinton Avenue West between the entry/exit ramps for Allen Road. The station currently has two levels: street level and the platform level for Line 1 trains. The station's pedestrian entrance, the station concourse and a bus terminal are all located at street level. The bus terminal, located in a fare-paid area, surrounds the concourse area with bus platforms on three of its four sides. After the opening of Line 5 Eglinton in 2021, Eglinton West will have two more station entrances: one just east of the Allen Road entry ramp, and the other just west of the Allen Road exit ramp. The new and current entrances will all be on the north side of Eglinton Avenue. On the south side of Eglinton Avenue just west of Everden Road, there is a possibility of an emergency exit or a fourth entrance to be incorporated into some future private development.The Line 5 tunnel and platform will pass under the Line 1 platforms. Above the Line 5 platform level, there will be a new underground concourse divided in two sections by a gap where the Line 1 tracks cross. Crossover tracks to reverse Line 5 trains will be located just east of the Line 5 platforms.</p><p>The station was designed by Arthur Erickson and Clifford & Lawrie.[9] The main ticketing and concourse area at surface level is sheltered by an exposed concrete space frame supported by eight circular columns. The concrete ceiling is, in effect, a large slab, and overhangs the entrance. With a glass curtain wall, it appears to float. Inside, it is coffered throughout the station, with skylights in certain areas, allowing for increased penetration of natural light. Eglinton West makes use of sandblasted concrete and brick wall finishes extensively, distinguishing it from most stations on Line 1 and Line 2 Bloor–Danforth, where tiles are predominant.</p><p>As the north end of the station is in Allen Road's median, the Line 1 platform level is partly built at surface level. Designers took advantage of this and added windows at platform level. The northbound platform has regular windows, allowing for a view onto Allen Road, while windows on the opposite platform are frosted, creating the impression of fog. This combination of windows allows transit riders to view cars speeding onto Allen Road's northbound expressway lanes, while blocking views of cars stuck in traffic at Eglinton, where the road originally planned and constructed as an expressway ends.</p><p>During July 2009, the TTC installed an $850,000 green roof over the northern end of the station to reduce maintenance costs, increase the lifespan to 40–50 years, reduce the heat island effect by lowering the temperature of the surrounding area by a few degrees, and to reduce runoff. The TTC had to repair the roof anyway, since it had been leaking since 2000. The plants atop the 835-square-metre roof are low-maintenance sedums. Victoria Park and Dufferin stations are slated to have green roofs installed as well.</p>"

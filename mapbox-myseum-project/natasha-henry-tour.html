The day after the catastrophe, Toronto journalists wrote countless stories of tragedy and survival as locals tried to pick up the pieces the storm carried down the overflowing river.</p><p>The story of Gerald Elliott is particularly harrowing. As a "lineman" (someone who fixed telephone lines), Elliott survived the flooding by clinging onto the branch of a "unbelievably sturdy little willow tree" as the floodwaters pounded the Long Branch neighbourhood. </p><p>Trouble began for Elliott when the floodwaters trapped him on a bridge on Old Mill Road, located today at Bloor St. on the Humber River. As the river rose with feverish intensity, he left his car and hung onto a tree while standing on its roof. Then, the water swept his car away and he held on for dear life.</p> <p>Luckily, police officers and firefighters from surrounding communities finally spotted Elliott after four hours on the branch. Working with local rescuers, Max Hurley took a small rowboat and carefully negotiated the raging waters as they rushed beneath Elliott.  He threw a rubber hose to cling onto, but after Elliott wrapped it around his waist, the hose broke and he flew off the bridge into the raging floodwaters. </p><p>Elliott thought he was done for. But in another stroke of luck, he grabbed another branch. Hundreds looked on until dawn and rescuers even tried using a helicopter to save him. Finally, however, Hurley persisted on his lifeboat and rowed the lineman to safety. That night, they rushed Elliot to St.Joseph’s hospital where he remained for hours covered in warm water bottles.</p>'

The storm that had already left a path of destruction over Haiti and the Carolinas had shrunk, but few could predict how it would affect Toronto's sensitive waterways and the neighbourhoods located beside them. <p></p>Floods of biblical proportions swept cars, fire trucks, homes, bridges and whole families into a raging flood that toppled the riverbanks of the Humber and even the Don. Newspaper accounts from the day after the storm reveal a night of tragedy and miracle. One thing is clear, though: Few, if any, expected a storm of this magnitude in Toronto. <p></p>On the Humber just south of Bloor St., five firefighters attempted to approach the riverbank to assist in the rescue operation. As they approached the waters, the firetruck remained above ground, but soon enough, the waters picked up and they could not return to higher ground. <p></p>Instead of panicking, the firefighters remained in place on River Road until they were rescued, but as they awaited assistance, the truck rolled over. In a moment of desperation, three of the men held onto the side of the truck and threw a rope to a car at the very edge of the floodwaters.</p><p>Witnesses recall that “the road washed out from under” and that even lifelong residents could not understand how the water became so elevated. One minute, the rescue workers were trying to calmly approach the water. The next, they were gone, and five firefighters, including deputy chief Clarence Collins, drowned in the flood. </p>"

          "state": "<p>The end of the First World War brought joy and happiness to Canadians, but just as people thought the end of war would bring an end to death and suffering, a curveball few expected would suddenly devastate the entire planet: The Spanish Flu.</p><p>The name itself is misleading. While epidemiologists have debated the origins of the virus, most studies point to an army base in Kansas as being ‘Ground Zero’ for the epidemic. While largely unnoticed at first, a second wave of the virus incurred its wrath upon unsuspecting cities. As the war died down and soldiers travelled from Europe to all regions of the world, the virus went from an issue of little concern to a matter of national security in a matter of days.</p><p>Consider the account from the Toronto Daily Star on October 1st, 1918. “Nothing in Present Situation to Warrant Closing of Public Places”, stated the Toronto Daily Star. encouraging people to simply get fresh air and to remain calm. Two days later, over 500 people would be admitted to the Military Base Hospital on Gerrard Street, though no deaths would yet be reported. In a sudden turnaround, newspapers ordered the virtual shutdown of the city. At the time, few--if anybody--expected the Spanish Flu to become the deadliest epidemic in recorded history. An alderman, not knowing just how deadly the latest strain would be, lamented that he was the only one in his family who had not been stricken with the flu.</p><p>“392 Deaths in City Since Flu Outbreak,” proclaimed the Star, noting that 27 people had died the day before. Worse yet, The Department of Public Health suffered a shortage of nurses because so many of them contracted the disease while treating other patients. Still, Toronto tried to keep a business-as-usual approach to daily life, with local regiments pushing war bonds, pharmacies pushing questionable flu remedies and newspapers filling the pages of the newspaper with war dispatches. After all, the war would end only a month after the first flu deaths. </p><p>The flu epidemic proved to be a turning point in Canada’s treatment of health epidemics. Clearly unprepared for a major plague, The Canadian government passed the Department of Health Act and the treatment of contagious disease, especially in big cities, would become the subject of intense focus and research for decades to come.</p><p>While the outbreak continued for several years and forced the cancellation of the Stanley Cup, it slowed down in the early 1920s and disappeared by the middle of the decade. Still, the flu marked a bittersweet end to the wartime destruction around the world. </p>"

Earlier in 1933, Adolf Hitler emerged as the winner of the German election with a populist platform that promised the return of good fortune and pride to Germany after a decade and a half of economic misery.</p><p>During a neighbourhood baseball game between the Harbord Playground team and another represented by St.Peter's church a couple of days before the brawl, someone pulled out a white flag containing a swastika, the Nazi symbol synonymous with white supremacy and hatred of Jewish people. Up to 10,000 people converged upon the park as the game suddenly became a platform for racial politics, and soon enough, young men brawled for over five hours in what the Toronto Daily Star called “one of the worst free-for-alls ever seen in the city.”</p><p>Stabbings and beatings forced several young men on both sides to go to Toronto Western Hospital, many of whom were simply bystanders drawn by the crowd. The Daily Star claims that the violence was due in part to many in the crowd chanting “Heil, Hitler”, the common Nazi German salute, towards those the Germans had already begun victimizing.</p><p>That very year, Adolf Hitler kickstarted twelve years of persecution, violence and genocide against Jews, Roma, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals, though even his supporters could not have predicted the horrific extent of the Third Reich.</p><p>Even after using horses, billie clubs and even exhaust smoke from motorcycles, the crowds at Christie Pits failed to disperse in an orderly manner. Only at 2am did the fighting begin to dissipate.</p>"

The Leaside airport, located in the Don Valley just south of the present day neighbourhood of the same name, became one of the first hubs for aircraft and aerial transportation in Canada.</p><p>The Summer of 1918 was significant because of a particular milestone: the first airmail flight in Canada made its way from Montreal to Toronto. But along with a bag full of letters, the pilot, Captain Brian Peck, also commandeered a cargo hold full of liquor so heavy that the plane barely got off the ground and even needed refueling in Kingston.</p><p>Peck flew to Montreal to perform aerial stunts to spur recruitment and military support, but a rainstorm delayed plans. Never one to waste a good opportunity, he agreed to perform the first airmail flight in Canadian history. But Peck required something else. His friend at the Leaside airport was getting married and wanted suitable “refreshments” for the wedding celebration. So beneath the seat of his Curtis JN4 aircraft, Peck became the first person in Canada to also smuggle alcohol by plane.</p><p>In 1916, the Ontario Legislature passed the Ontario Temperance Act, a ruling that barred the sale and distribution of liquor in the province. Always in demand, however, smugglers thought of novel ways to acquire their libations, and the aerial option offered a new, experimental alternative that nobody—including the mayor—saw coming.</p><p>When the plane landed in Kingston to refuel, the suppliers did not have the proper gasoline and the flight stopped short, again, in the town of Deseronto. After six and a half hours, the plane descended towards Leaside airport beneath the city’s relatively new powerlines. Once he landed, though, Beck removed the cargo and mail so quickly that authorities had no time to react.</p><p>Still, the flight would go down in history for changing the way we send mail in Canada. Only a half century later would the the truth about the smuggled contraband be revealed.</p>"

Rarely, however, are tributes paid to the private lives of public figures, all of whom endure the triumph and tragedy of personal relationships.</p><p>During the early 1800s, one relationship in particular captivated the 2,000 or so residents of York. Anne Powell, the daughter of Chief Justice William Dummer Powell, fell madly in love with war veteran John Beverley Robinson, who fought the Americans in the War of 1812. In the young community isolated from the gossip of Buckingham Palace, Anne became the subject of infamy when she declared she was still in love with Robinson even after he married another woman from England.</p><p>Despite the obvious barriers, Anne persisted by showing up at his house on John and Beverley, and when the soldier left for England, Anne tried to pursue them across the Atlantic Ocean, but not before her parents locked her in her bedroom to prevent her from going. Still, locks didn’t prevent her from escaping and trailing Robinson and his wife, Emma, as they rode a sleigh to New York City. The captain of the ship assured Robinson that Anne would not be allowed on the England-boat ship.</p><p>So Anne took the following vessel, a trip that would prove to be her fate. Upon approaching the Irish coast, a gale threw broke the mast of the ship and killed 45 of the 56 passengers. Her body was so disfigured that it could only be identified by a piece of jewelry worn around her neck. Robinson traveled to Ireland and was the one that identified her.</p>For the Powell family, this story--bearing all the hallmarks of a Victorian tragedy--marked the beginning of the end of their sterling reputation in Upper Canada. But Robinson only grew the social standing of his family, and in 1829, became Chief Justice of Upper Canada and was even knighted for his troubles. He would die in 1863, three years before confederation.</p>"

Unsurprisingly, the contest drew the ire of local and international figures alike, including Margaret Sanger, pioneer of reproductive rights. She called the Stork Derby “deplorable” and argued that it reduced women to animals.</p><p>The extended Millar family also bemoaned the morality of the Derby, arguing that it went against social good and therefore should be considered null.

Like so many others at the time. Escaping slavery meant more than just escaping slave owners. During the 1850s in the mostly abolitionist North, kidnappers working for slave owners captured free black citizens to force them to work on plantations in the American South. And with the Fugitive Slave Act in effect in the year 1850, any slave deemed “escaped” would be deemed a fugitive of the law. </p><p>During the Christmas Holidays of 1855, the Masters of The Wanzer’s and Grigsby’s took advantage of the absence of their owners to escape via horse-drawn carriage. After about 100 miles of travel, the escapees encountered a group of white men, who promptly ordered they disembark from their carriage and surrender. Suddenly, the slaves pulled out knives and guns themselves and engaged in a tense standoff. Fortunately, the white men retreated, and they made it all the way to Philadelphia.</p> <p>From there, they met the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, a group associated with the Underground Railroad and the many abolition societies that existed in North America. The Railroad, though not a literal train track, contained organizations and people that acted as “conductors” -- people who transport slaves to safe harbour -- and stationmasters, who house slaves in churches. Once in Syracuse, the couples travelled to Toronto, where they were finally free from recapture. There, they met Mrs. Agnes Willis, who ran the Ladies’ Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives. Like other abolitionist groups, she provided employment for the escapees upon arrival and made sure they found a place to live.</p>"

A giant in both size and presence, his ability to combine storytelling and wit inspired both admiration and furor from socialites. He would soon put his talents to good use.</p><p>The 1880s proved to be an interesting era in the United States and Canada, as rising populations in urban centres led to a booming lecture and performance circuit. Mark Twain roused audiences with his Mississippi Sketches; France’s Sarah Bernhardt captured theatregoers hearts with her signature tragedies; and Wilde, still only 25 and in need of quick money, hopped on a ship to North America to spread his dry wit and wisdom to the raucous crowds.</p><p>Two of the 125 lectures performed by Wilde in North America took place in Toronto, the first at the Grand Opera House on Adelaide, the second at the Allan Gardens Conservatory. In classic Wilde style, his performances riffed on the differences between American and European sensibilities, and he spent a good amount of time criticizing North American furniture.<p>"

Born in Collins Bay near Kingston, he enlisted in the army at the very beginning of the war and fought in Ypres, one of the most brutal theatres of war. It was there that a sniper’s bullet struck him directly in face, causing him to lose sight in both his eyes. Listless, Baker felt powerless. His girlfriend left him because she said she could never marry a blind man. Baker fell into a deep depression until a newspaper publisher, Sir Arthur Pearson, gifted the soldier a watch with braille markings. Able to tell the time, the wounded soldier figured he could do anything.</p><p>Baker promised to never let his lack of vision impede his autonomy for the rest of his life—an understatement considering his accomplishments. Once he returned to Canada, friends were so wowed by his can-do attitude that they set him up with a position an Ontario Hydro.</p><p>But even that wasn’t enough. When he learned that the Canadian Free Library for the Blind was closing, he urged the Toronto Women’s Musical Club to keep them afloat, and from then on he provided occupational training for the visually impaired. This would later turn into the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, a nationally-renowned organization that quickly provided work opportunities for the visually impaired in factories and offices. As the CNIB grew in size and stature, Baker continued as a spokesman for the Canadian Military and the welfare of veterans, and in 1951, the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind tapped him to be their first president.</p><p>As a final feather in his cap, the Canadian government named him one of 150 outstanding living Canadians for the 1967 centennial celebrations.</p>"

The physically and psychologically wounded, many of them unable to work, gathered on the aptly-named Shrapnel's Corner at the intersection of College and Yonge.</p> <p>Bothered by the loitering, small business owners demanded the removal of benches at the corner. Soon, however, ire towards veterans soon became a racial issue, with locals scapegoating many Greek immigrants because some had not enlisted in the Canadian forces. Soon, barroom brawls turned into full-scale riots, with primarily white, English veterans fighting Greek immigrants and demanding the release of their arrested comrades.</p><p>The crowds primarily gathered at two places: Shrapnel's Corners and Victoria & Adelaide. Both men and women openly smashed and targeted Greek restaurants, and despite threats from the mayor's office, the riots continued for four days.</p><p>Paired with war time frustration, the anti-Greek rhetoric could not have been further from the truth. Far from objecting to the war effort, the Greek community reminded Torontonians that they supported the allies and that over 2,000 Greeks fought for the Canadian Expeditionary Forces. Still, the insurmountable death toll of the war cannot be ignored as a factor in the riots. Given that some majority-English neighbourhoods like Earlscourt suffered an immense amount of casualties, and given that in August of 1918, the war that was supposed to last a few months offered no end in sight, rioters felt that they weren't getting a fair shake.</p>"

George Louis Chuvalo, the son of Croatian immigrants who grew up in the Junction, would take on perhaps the most famous boxer in history at Maple Leaf Gardens. While Chuvalo ascended to as high as second place in the world heavyweight boxing rankings, few expected him to put up a fight against somebody who called himself “The Greatest” and had the skills to back it up.</p><p>During the 1960s, the sport of boxing took a wildly political turn when Muhammad Ali decried the Vietnam War and declared his refusal to serve overseas for the American military. As thousands of Americans fled to Canada as conscientious objectors, locals supported Ali and soon the city became abuzz with anticipation. A Canadian would be taking on a living legend in their own backyard for the most prestigious title in the sport.</p><p>But Chuvalo's famous battle was not even meant to happen. Only a few weeks earlier, Ali's comments forced the postponement of a title fight in Chicago. The governor of Illinois himself ordered the fight to be cancelled. The original contender, Ernie Terrell, also pulled out because the Chicago Mob could not match the influence of Ali's funders in the radical group the Nation of Islam.</p><p>As hatred against Ali grew, Canadian fans maintained their admiration for the fighter, and given that Chuvalo likewise sold arenas out, they decided to pack 18,000 people into Maple Leaf Gardens. Conn Smythe, owner of the Maple Leafs, objected to the fight but was overruled; it soon became clear that Torontonians wanted desperately to see Ali fight regardless of the circumstances. </p><p>Many predicted that Ali would simply walk over Chuvalo, but few expected an equal fight that would go all 15 rounds. Both nimble and defensive, both fighters turned the fight into a trial of endurance. Chuvalo, who had actually beaten many boxing greats from the United States, took a heavy beating but replied forcefully with devastating kidney shots that would send Ali to the hospital. Regardless, Ali ended up scoring a victory, but not before Chuvalo gained the respect of Canada, the world, and Muhammad Ali himself. They would remain friends after the fight.</p>"

Performing one of the century’s most notorious plays, Alexandre Dumas’ La Dame Aux Camelias, theatre managers vexed about ticket sales urged her to change the name of the play to Camille to ward off detractors. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church in Toronto and Montreal spoke out against the abominable actress, and even the newspapers painted the thespian as a sinful, fallen woman tainting the souls of the community.</p><p>The warnings of the clergy and press warded off crowds for the opening matinee of Camille, but audiences were so impressed by the performance that they gasped and applauded at her every move.

It was there that her “awkward” mannerisms and personality soon came in handy.</p><p>Realizing she could rouse laughter with her physical mannerisms, she became a sensation among London theatregoers and soon entertained the press on both sides of the Atlantic. After marrying Robert Peel, the great grandson of the British prime minister of the same name, she traveled to New York City to debut. Broadway audiences likewise enjoyed her irreverent, whimsical attitude. To their amazement, she could turn any song into a comedy bit with her tongue-in-cheek performances.In 1939, her son enlisted in the army for the Second World War, and she spent a good amount of time entertaining troops. In 1942, however, her son would be declared missing in action off the Indian Coast.</p><p>After the war, she dabbled with film acting, but her true home would always be the stage. In 1989, she died at the age of 94, and in her honour, the Duke of Edinburgh installed a plaque at 1115 Queen St, located just around the corner from the small house she grew up in.</p>"

But that’s exactly what former prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King commissioned for his younger brother Max when he died in 1922. Located the the Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, the tomb is modeled perfectly after the burial arrangements of Louis Pasteur, the father of microbiology and a pioneer of germ theory.</p><p>There is good reason for Max’s burial arrangements. Descendants of William Lyon Mackenzie, leader of the 1837 Upper Canada rebellion, The King’s shed their reputation as a treasonous family and successfully established themselves as a reputable family within legal circles in Kitchener in Toronto. After moving to downtown Toronto, William soon participated in public activism while Max pursued medicine. After joining the medical corps in South Africa during the Boer War of 1899, Max lived a long way from home in remote parts of the continent. While the experience would eventually lend him well in opening his own medical practice in Ottawa, the ordeal had a damaging impact on his health. In 1913, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and needed to spend over two years in Colorado to heal from his ailments. Industrious as the rest of the family, however, he nevertheless penned the self-explanatory book, The Battle of Tuberculosis and How to Win It.</p><p>While Max endured the vicissitudes of disease, William rose to the highest echelons of political power in Canada. In 1921, 13 years after becoming Minister of Labour and two years after becoming leader of the Liberal Party, William Lyon Mackenzie King became Prime Minister. The first telegram he sent was to his brother.</p><p>Even in sickness, the William trusted his own brother, more so than some of his advisors. On March 18th, 1922, however, Max died of his decade-long illness. As a tribute to his brother’s battle, William invoked the tuberculosis-fighting French biologist Louis Pasteur, who was buried in a tomb beneath the institute that bears his name. The tombs are similar except for one small addition on William’s part: a Celtic cross, the kind used by their scottish ancestors.</p>"

But what you might not know is that Saunders was not only a Toronto resident for a good part of her life, but that many of the stories she wrote—most of them about animal-human companionship—are actually inspired by real events.</p><p>Saunders was born in Nova Scotia in 1861, the daughter of a baptist minister who lived in a rural village. As a child, she would develop a lifelong love for both books and pets as she spent her time in relative solitude. While still young, she tried submitting manuscripts to publishers, but after one acceptance and many failures, she turned briefly to Ottawa to become a public servant.</p> <p>In 1892, however, she heard a story that would change her life forever. While visiting Meaford, Ontario, a man found a dog who had both his ears and his tail cut off. Horrified, he immediately adopted the dog and they remained together. Touched deeply by the companionship, she submitted an autobiographical account of the story to a writing contest and won. While the prize alone was relatively meager, Beautiful Joe, as it ended up being called, was published and became a smash hit in several countries.</p><p>Unfortunately for Saunders, she negotiated low on the royalties and remained in modest circumstances for most of her life. Still, in her boarding house of George Street and her small cottage on Glengowan Avenue, she became a defender of animals and their rights to the point that she was known across the country for her activism. She kept pets that she named after street locations, such as a pigeon called 38 Front Street.</p><p>In 1934, she received the Order of the British Empire for her contribution to Canadian literature and animal rights.</p>"

As a Civil War captain and medical officer for the Union Army in the United States, his contribution to American history is astonishing as well.</p><p>For many of the black families living in Southern Ontario during the 19th century, life in Toronto, Leamington, Hamilton and Windsor meant a life away from slavery in America’s Confederate South. The Underground Railroad, a secretive collective of abolitionists located in both the United States and Canada, sought to free slaves by transporting them across border lines from as far as Mississippi to the Canadian line.</p><p>In Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe had attempted to end slavery in Canada with the Anti-Slavery act in the year 1793, but wealthy landowners protested and refused to give away what they deemed to be property. Instead, slaves would not go free, but black immigrants would be deemed free in Canada.</p> <p>Abbott’s parents arrived in Toronto in 1835, as part of the approximately 30,000 black people who sought refuge in Canada before the Emancipation Proclamation. During the time, black men actually formed regiments to fight on the government side in William Lyon Mackenzie’s Rebellion in 1837.</p><p>From an early age, Abbott knew that he wanted to be a doctor. After graduating from the University of Toronto, he became the first black doctor born in Canada. Shortly after graduating, he joined the American army as the medical officer who would help in army hospitals on the front. He was one of only eight black physicians who participated in the American Civil War. </p><p>At the height of the Civil War in 1863, Abraham Lincoln invited Abbott to the White House, a meeting that drew infamy for the shocked reception of the crowd. Few during that period of time could have imagined a black man as army captain, but militarily he excelled in the position for the army that would achieve decisive victory. Lincoln and the First Lady remembered the meeting fondly, and were so moved by Abbott that when he died, Mary Todd Lincoln sent him the shawl he wore during his inauguration.</p><p>Abbott would eventually settle in Parkdale, at that point the extreme west of the city. He moved to Toronto after running a successful practice in Southern Ontario.</p>"

Located on the shores of Lake Ontario, the chilly water provided much-needed respite from the scorching temperatures of the city heat. Without air conditioning, those living in the downtown core—especially in rowhouses and apartment buildings—suffered greatly during heat waves to the point of death. In 1935, a heat wave killed over a thousand people in Ontario and Manitoba when temperatures shot up to 40 degrees Celsius. During the warmest evenings, Torontonians actually slept on the beach.Archival images show just how important the beach was in the dog days of summer. Thousands gathered on the shore to not only swim, but to also visit the boardwalk, play carnival games and ride the Sunnyside Flyer roller coaster, all of which are now gone. The Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion is a striking example of Mediterranean architecture that stands in contrast to the Victorian-era British architecture of downtown Toronto. With thousands of lockers, a terrace and a garden, the pavilion invokes the famous bathing facilities popular during the Roman Empire. While the beach is still used today for various purposes, its popularity declined after the city built the Gardiner Expressway to better connect Downtown Toront</p>"

The brass marker informs visitors to the building that literary giant Ernest Hemingway lived there in 1923-24 while working for the Toronto Star.</p><p>I’ve always been intrigued by Hemingway, ever since his Old Man and the Sea was imposed on me in high school, and his lamentations on growing old (in Idaho) left an imprint. Back when Hemingway inhabited 1597-1599 Bathurst, the building was called Cedarvale Mansions, and the mystery that eluded Greg Heal, one of its current residents, was which unit the novelist called home.</p><p>“It was sort of nice when we had the mystery of what unit Hemingway lived in — we couldn’t figure it out,” Heal admits. “It was one of my hobbies to reach out to various resources: the John F. Kennedy Library.” Heal has resided in the building since the early ’90s and experienced its transition from a co-operative to a condominium. So, when one particular unit went up for sale two years ago the owners were looking to reinvigorate the sale of their apartment. “They reached out to me and said, ‘Oh Greg, is there anything current on the search for Hemingway?’ I said no. ‘Well, keep at it’,” Heal recalls. “He was able to connect with some writers who were putting together a book on Hemingway’s papers and, lo and behold, they just had a copy of his lease.”</p><p>That lease revealed the unit in question to be Number 19, where accountant Pat Cavanagh, 33, now lives, and took possession Nov. 1, 2013. He admits that when he purchased the unit it wasn’t known his abode was For Whom The Bell Tolls, and when he did learn of the unit’s former lodger he was far from awestruck.</p><p>“I’ll be totally honest, there was a bit of ignorance.” Cavanagh shares. “I know of him [but] I’ve actually never read any of his books. It was a cool thing to hear.”</p><p>That’s not to say Cavanagh doesn’t read. At least one of Hemingway’s celebrated works is on his to-read bookshelf.</p><p>“I am somewhat of an avid reader, and I do have one that I’m trying to get to of his,” he admits.</p>Much like the rumours of one of Hemingway’s contemporaries, Sinclair Lewis, it is alleged that Lewis hid his works in the basement of the Palmer House Hotel in Sauk Centre, Minn.No such luck here in Toronto.</p><p>“It’s always been a running joke that, ‘Hey, if you find some Hemingway papers you might be able to pay for your renovation, but nothing like that has turned up,” Heal says, with a laugh. “It’s an old building. You’ll never know what you’ll find.”</p><p>The unit in question was renovated before Cavanagh took possession.</p><p>Now, as much as the literary community loves Hemingway, the writer was not particularly keen on Hogtown.</p><p>Heal tells a story about how the bullfighting fan broke his lease at the building.</p><p>With Toronto being a fairly stayed place for a person who came from Chicago — itself a very vibrant city — Hemingway wanted to break his lease so he could go off to what was a more exciting Paris. He threw a party, and to each of his revelers that he invited he requested they take something with them when they left.</p><p>“It was a way for him to surreptitiously get his stuff out of the suite so the landlord wasn’t catching on to the fact that he was busting his lease, and he would be able to get his personal belongings out” Heal says. “That was a very creative way to take flight.”</p>"
